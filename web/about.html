            <h1>Why ORQL Exists</h1>
            <p class="hero-quote">"Most systems we obey are just consensus hallucinations. They feel real because we all act as if they are."</p>
            <p class="hero-text">I am aware that the theory I am proposing is most likely false, or at least partially false but all I want it to do is to jailbreak the existing way of computation which I believe might be why we are hitting a wall in quantum physics and unified theories. Many breakthrough physics ideas developed from theories that were false like Bohr's atomic model that jailbroke classical physics and led us to Quantum Mechanics, possibly even String Theory that has yielded powerful mathematical tools (AdS/CFT, holography). We are limited in our perceptive tools as humans - 3d physical objects, ripples of a bigger field. Like how ants sense we exist but have no clue that I am taking a sound bath class or sending a photo of monkey memes to my mom because they simply lack the tools to perceive and comprehend it. I am guessing that much like AdS/CFT we might be in a singularity hologram that contains a 1 and 0 and everything else is a sequencing of the rest in all sorts of ways that keeps expanding with entropy like a blossoming flower branching into infinity. What I am saying probably answers and raises millions of questions but my goal is to simply push the needle into a jailbreak of the classical modes of thinking. I am probably mostly wrong and I accept/embrace that whole heartedly as a part of the unfolding.</p>

                    <h3>üîç Semantic Skepticism</h3>
                    <p>We live in a world shaped by language, not necessarily truth. Words like "ownership," "rights," and even "reality" are semantic constructs ‚Äî tools of convenience, not ontological fact. (This relates to ORQL because "measurement," "collapse," and "observer" might be limiting words that constrain how we think about quantum mechanics. ORQL tries to rebuild these concepts from scratch.)</p>

                    <h3>üèóÔ∏è Ontology Over Narrative</h3>
                    <p>I prioritize structural truth over emotionally satisfying stories. Progress doesn't come from feeling good about ideas ‚Äî it comes from seeing what's under them. (ORQL might not be a comforting interpretation of QM, but it tries to expose the structural role of observers rather than hiding it behind narratives about "universal wavefunctions" or "consciousness causing collapse.")</p>

                    <p>When you understand the source code of a system, you stop negotiating with its bugs. ORQL is about redesigning foundations, not patching symptoms. (Think of it like this: most approaches try to work around quantum measurement's weirdness - adding interpretations on top. ORQL says: what if we rebuild from scratch with observers built in from the start?)</p>

            <h2>Why I Built ORQL</h2>
            
            <div class="story-content">
                <p class="lead">ORQL was born from existing quantum theories ignoring the observer as a formal entity, and that felt like a foundational error. Quantum mechanics treats the observer as something external, undefined, or tacked on after the math. But in reality, every measurement, every collapse, every "world" happens from the perspective of an observer embedded in the system.</p>
                
                <h3>Why ORQL Had to Exist:</h3>
                <ul class="belief-list">
                    <li>I was dissatisfied with current interpretations of the wavefunction collapse as they felt incomplete. Copenhagen's vagueness and MWI's total abstraction.</li>
                    <li>I needed a system where collapse is not universal, but local to the observer's information state.</li>
                    <li>I wanted to describe how different observers in the same system can diverge without contradiction.</li>
                    <li>I am willing to break with orthodoxy - but not logic - to get there.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote class="mission-statement">
                    ORQL is a process shaped by memory, entanglement, and informational context. ORQL exists to add observers to the quantum equation ‚Äî to formalize subjective collapse, divergence, and meaning without sacrificing logic. It's a new language for a reality that's always been relational.

                    <p>I'd rather say "we don't know" than pretend an illusion is true. This pursuit is about getting closer to what's real, even if that means admitting most of what we "know" might be wrong.</p>

                    <li>Don't accept institutions as evidence</li>
                    <li>Experience is real, but not always materially real</li>
                    <li>Most people debate within fictions. Better to reprogram the framework</li>
