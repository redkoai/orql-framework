                    <p>We live in a world shaped by language, not necessarily truth. Words like "ownership," "rights," and even "reality" are semantic constructs ‚Äî tools of convenience, not ontological fact.</p>

            <h2>Why I Built ORQL</h2>
            
            <div class="story-content">
                <p class="lead">ORQL was born from a deep dissatisfaction with the gap between quantum formalism and lived experience.</p>
                
                <p>I wanted a computable, symbolic system that reflects how observers actually experience measurement ‚Äî not just as abstract math, but as a process shaped by memory, entanglement, and informational context.</p>
                
                <p>I built ORQL because:</p>
                <ul class="belief-list">
                    <li>I reject the idea that there's one objective, global reality</li>
                    <li>Physics needs to account for the observer, not just the system</li>
                    <li>Existing interpretations were either incomplete or failed to match lived experience</li>
                    <li>We need a bridge between mathematical structure and subjective perception</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote class="mission-statement">
                    ORQL exists to reframe quantum mechanics around observers, not abstractions ‚Äî to formalize subjective collapse, divergence, and meaning without sacrificing logic. It's a new language for a reality that's always been relational.

                <p class="intro">I'm Anya Ozmen ‚Äî neuropsychology-trained founder, independent researcher, and builder of weird but precise systems.</p>
                
                <p>I created ORQL because none of the current quantum interpretations felt honest to how perception and uncertainty really work. As someone with a background in neuropsychology who's always been obsessed with the gap between perception and objective truth, ORQL combines my belief in information-theoretic reality with my desire to model how the brain, physics, and subjectivity intertwine.</p>
                
                <p>I believe the next scientific frontier won't come from polished institutions but from messy minds who feel things deeply and think across domains ‚Äî math, philosophy, cognition, and code.</p>
                
                <p class="outro">I also build games, trading bots, AI, and diagnostic systems. I like reality best when it's reprogrammable.</p>
